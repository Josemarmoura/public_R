This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}

library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/jmcme/OneDrive/Trebas Course/1.3 Trebas Curse - 201-MAN-TQ/1.3.2 Activity/ABD_CSA_07-main/customer_eval.csv")
rename(df, InvoiceDate_Old = InvoiceDate)

df <- transform(df,"InvoiceDate"=as.Date(substr(InvoiceDate,1,10),"%m/%d/%Y" ))
df$TotalValue <- df$Quantity * df$UnitPrice
df_customer <- df %>%
  group_by(CustomerID) %>%
  summarize(
    CustomerLifetime = as.numeric(2), # I am supposed 2 months.
    #CustomerLifetime = as.numeric(max(InvoiceDate) - min(InvoiceDate)), 
    NumPurchases = n(), # calcula o número total de compras
    TotalValue = sum(TotalValue) # calcula o valor monetário total
  )
df_customer$AvgPurchaseValue <- df_customer$TotalValue / df_customer$NumPurchases
df_customer$PurchaseFrequency <- df_customer$NumPurchases / df_customer$CustomerLifetime

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
